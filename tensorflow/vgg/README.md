# VGG 16 and 19
## On Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick (NCS)

## Prerequisites

This code example requires that the following components are available:
1. <a href="https://developer.movidius.com/buy" target="_blank">Movidius Neural Compute Stick</a>
2. <a href="https://developer.movidius.com/start" target="_blank">Movidius Neural Compute SDK</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow" target="_blank">TensorFlow source repo</a>
4. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models" target="_blank">TensorFlow models repo</a>

## Running this example

~~~
mkdir -p ~/workspace/tensorflow

# Clone TensorFlow source and models repo
cd ~/workspace/tensorflow
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models

# Clone NC App Zoo
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo

# Download, export, freeze and profile model
cd ~/workspace/ncappzoo/tensorflow/inception/
export TF_SRC_PATH=~/workspace/tensorflow/tensorflow
export TF_MODELS_PATH=~/workspace/tensorflow/models
make
~~~

If `make` ran normally and your computer is able to connect to the NCS device, the output will be similar to this:

~~~
Downloading checkpoint files...
...
Exporting GraphDef file...
...
Freezing model for inference...
...
Profiling the model...
...

Movidius graph generated! You can run inferences using ncappzoo/apps/image-classifier project.
~~~

## Configuring this example
This example profiles VGG_16 by default, but you can profile other versions as well. Below are some example commands:

VGG_19
~~~
make VERSION=19
~~~

### Compiling and validating the models
The Makefile only runs NCS <a href="https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/tools/profile.html" target="_blank">profiler</a> by default, but you can also compile and validate the model using the <a href="https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/tools/compile.html" target="_blank">compile</a> and <a href="https://movidius.github.io/ncsdk/tools/check.html" target="_blank">check</a> targets. Below are some example commands:

Validate VGG_19 
~~~
make check VERSION=19
~~~

Compile VGG_16
~~~
make compile VERSION=16
~~~

> NOTE: NCS profiler generates a Movidius graph file, so if you have already run the profiler on a specific model, there is no reason to run the compiler for the same model.

## Troubleshooting

~~~
Makefile:31: *** TF_MODELS_PATH is not defined. Run `export TF_MODELS_PATH=path/to/your/tensorflow/models/repo`.  Stop.
~~~
* Make sure TF_MODELS_PATH is pointing to your tensorflow models directory.

~~~
Makefile:46: *** TF_SRC_PATH is not defined. Run `export TF_SRC_PATH=path/to/your/tensorflow/source/repo`.  Stop.
~~~
* Make sure TF_SRC_PATH is pointing to your tensorflow source directory.
